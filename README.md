# About the project 
The main task to make the robot avoid the golden token and when it detects silver token head to it , grab , move it behind then continue the arena.

# How to run 
Go to the direction of the folder and run in the terminal

python run.py assignment_1.py

# Algorithm
 As it's mentioned in the flowchart : 
- The robot starts to search for the golden tokens if he finds it it checks, if there is silver token if there in range the robot heading to it if no it trys to avoid the gilden by measuring the distance on his right and left distances and head to the farther
- And if there is no golden token it checks again the silver tokens if there no it drives if yes it heads to it and grab it then do the grab action 

# Possible improvements 
as it's mentioned in the file: 
- Try to implement propotional control for the turning and driving functions 
- use diffrent algorithms for detecting the required angle and distance with fixed refrences (arena markers).
